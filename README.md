# Python Games
Some python games made years ago. These were what really got me into programming. They're base from Rice University's An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, and Principles of Computing.

## Dependencies to install
Most of these games requires the following modules:
* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
* [SimpleGUICS2Pygame](https://simpleguics2pygame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

It's possible to run the game directly in your browser by clicking the hyperlink in the titles. 

## What are the games about?
* [Blackjack](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_xqqBMj7T0T_0.py)
 - Comparing card game between a player and dealer. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or letting the dealer draw additional cards until the hand exceeds 21.
* [Guess the Number](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_DDEBpwvvQfU8731.py)
 - Game that challenges the player to find a number based on greater than or less than with feedback.
* [Memory](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_6DloZwBbeKNFzjv.py)
 - The first player chooses a card and then selects another card and turns it over. If they match, they remain side up.  If not, they are turned back over. One all the cards have been played, the game is over.
* [Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_xgTeQFDX5HqgB7q.py)
 - The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. The rules are:
   - Scissors cuts Paper
   - Paper covers Rock
   - Rock crushes Lizard
   - Lizard poisons Spock
   - Spock smashes Scissors
   - Scissors decapitates Lizard
   - Lizard eats Paper
   - Paper disproves Spock
   - Spock vaporizes Rock
   - (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
* [Stopwatch](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_CetsPOSQfWIURfH.py)
 - Game with a digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. If the user stop the watch when the tenth of a second is equal to zero (0), the player gets a point.
* [The Fifteen Puzzle](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_ovWofUC2cB7R3GR.py)
 - Sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space (tile zero (0)).
* [Tic-Tac-Toe (Montecarlo Method)](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_zRSeSwzesqt3Boe.py)
 - Tic-Tac-Toe game that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.
* [Tic-Tac-Toe (Mini-max Method)](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_PEcZ9OCQy6yhqP3.py)
 - Tic-Tac-Toe that rules for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. Covers both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves.
* [Zombie Apocalypse](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user42_RUqUgflI7z5yWn8.py)
 - Zombies are red, and they move when the use clicks a specific button to move, to follow humans. On the other hand, humans are green, and then the player clicks another button, they flee from the zombies. When a zombie catch up with a human, it's color change from green to purple, showing that they're infected. The player can also put some objects in the map to make the game more interesting.
